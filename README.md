# APISearchMadHack

This is the website part that wa built during Madhack 2015. 
The idea of the app is to build a platform to compile every API that we can find (crawl) on the internet and build a "one place" for developers to go to and search for all kinds of APIs.
Data are crawled and sits in a vm hosted by Azure. The website is also hosted by Azure currently. Address: http://apeye.azurewebsites.net/
